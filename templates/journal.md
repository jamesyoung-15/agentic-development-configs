Format: `YYYY-MM-DD  tag  one line`

Tags: `fail` (tried, did not work), `why` (decision made), `found` (learned
something not in the code), `wrong` (an assumption was invalid).

```
2026-10-20  found  Inventory plugin caches for 15 min, explains the stale host list
2026-10-20  fail   Raising forks to 50 changed nothing, bottleneck is the plugin not parallelism
2026-10-20  why    Pinned the collection instead of patching upstream, see docs/adr/0003
2026-10-21  wrong  The retry wrapper does not cover timeouts, only non-2xx
```

Negative results are the point. The `fail` lines are what stop the same dead
end being walked twice.
